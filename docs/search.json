This installation includes the R language and a graphical user interface (GUI). Rather using the GUI, we recommend installing RStudio - an integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you interact with R with some added benefits."

Live sessions, forums, and interactive elements will enhance the learning experience.\n\nQ: What resources will be provided?\n\nParticipants will have access to video lectures, reading materials, hands-on projects, and additional resources to support their learning journey.\n\nQ: Do I need any specific software for the course?\n\nYes, participants will need to have R and RStudio installed on their computers. Instructions on setting up the environment will be provided at the beginning of the course.\n\nQ: Can I take this course on a mobile device?\n\nWhile it‚Äôs recommended to have access to a computer for the best learning experience, some elements of the course may be accessible on mobile devices. However, hands-on projects are more effectively completed on a computer.\n\nQ: Are there any specific technical requirements?\n\nParticipants should have a reliable internet connection and a computer that meets the minimum requirements for running R and RStudio.\n\nQ: Is there a certification upon completion of the course?\n\nYes, participants who successfully complete the course, including hands-on projects and assessments, will receive a certificate of completion.\n\nQ: How is the final project evaluated?\n\nThe final project will be evaluated through a peer review process, allowing participants to receive constructive feedback from their peers.\n\nQ: How do I enroll in the course?\n\nYou can enroll by visiting [Your Course Website] and following the enrollment instructions. Limited seats are available, so it‚Äôs recommended to secure your spot early."
